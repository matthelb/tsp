     4  Daniel Elstner
     4  David King
     1  Jonathon Jongsma

1.8.2:

* Fix accidental ABI breakage from 1.8.0.  All users are urged to please upgrade
  from 1.8.0 to 1.8.2 as soon as possible

1.8.0:

* No notable changes since 1.7.2

1.7.2 (UNSTABLE):

* API Changes (all API changes are in unstable API introduced in 1.7.x)
  * UserFontFace is not implemented with virtual functions rather than by
    registering callbacks
  * Cairo::scaled_matrix() -> Cairo::scaling_matrix() to match other matrix
    convenience functions
* Bugfixes
  * Incorrect refcounting on ScaledFont
  * build fixes for Mac OSX
* Contributors for this release:
     1	Armin Burgmeier
     1	Dave Evans
    22	Jonathon Jongsma


1.7.0 (UNSTABLE):

 * API Changes
   * ScaledFont: Change fontface constructor parameter to be a RefPtr
     * This is an API break, but the old interface was essentially unusably
       broken
   * Cairo::Matrix now inherits from cairo_matrix_t
     * Previously, we had used Cairo::Matrix throughout our API, but
       Cairo::Matrix was just a typedef for cairo_matrix_t
     * This could be considered an API change, but the new Cairo::Matrix still
       is-a cairo_matrix_t even if it's not exactly a cairo_matrix_t.  This
       change does not break ABI either, as there are no data members or virtual
       functions.  So I believe this is a safe change, but feedback is appreciated.
     * Provides a much more C++-friendly API for handling matrices
     * Also added a set of standalone 'generator' functions for generating
       starting matrices:
       * Cairo::identity_matrix(), rotation_matrix(), translation_matrix(),
         scaled_matrix().  This allows for convenient use such as:
           cr->set_matrix(Cairo::identity_matrix());
         rather than something like what was required before:
           Cairo::Matrix identity_matrix;
           cairo_matrix_init_identity(&identity_matrix);
           cr->set_matrix(identity_matrix);
   * Pattern: get/set_matrix() functions were using a cairo_matrix_t parameter in
     the API.  This is the only place where we used this type and so it was
     inconsistent with every other matrix-related API in cairomm.  Previously
     this wasn't really an issue since cairo_matrix_t and Cairo::Matrix were
     typedefed to the same type.  However, with the the change to Cairo::Matrix
     mentioned above, this because a much bigger issue.
     * This is an ABI-compatible change, but it is a minor API change that could
       result in some warnings or compile problems in some situations`
 * New API (some of these are new in cairo 1.8, some are older API that were
   not wrapped in cairomm previously)
   * Add Context::get/set_scaled_font()
   * add Context::show_text_glyphs()
   * add Context::get_font_options()
   * Add Surface::has_show_text_glyphs()
   * Add Surface::get_content() + test
   * Added Surface::get_fallback_resolution()
   * Add ScaledFont::text_to_glyphs()
   * Add PsSurface::get_eps()
   * Add missing Win32Surface API: create_with_ddb(), create_with_dib(), and get_image()
   * Add Win32PrintingSurface
   * Vastly improved font support
     * ToyFontFace
     * UserFontFace
     * Add Freetype font support (FtFontFace, etc)
     * Add win32 font support (Win32FontFace, etc)
     * Add quartz font support (QuartzFontFace, etc)
     * Add ScaledFont::get_scale_matrix()
 * Fix API inconsistencies by adding overloads and deprecating old versions
   * Deprecated FontFace::extents() in favor of FontFace::get_extents()
   * Deprecated FontFace::text_extents() in favor of FontFace::get_text_extents()
   * Deprecated FontFace::glyph_extents() in favor of FontFace::get_glyph_extents()
   * Add sigc::slot versions of all of the functions that take a
     cairo_write_func_t or cairo_read_func_t
     * This adds a new dependency on libsigc++, but offers a much more flexible
       and C++-like solution
     * Old API using cairo_write_func_t / cairo_read_func_t still exist, but are
       deprecated in favor of the new API
   * Add a default value for the font_options parameter of the ScaledFont constructor
 * Added new macros for determining library version:
   * CAIROMM_MAJOR_VERSION, CAIROMM_MINOR_VERSION, and CAIROMM_MICRO_VERSION
 * Add a bunch of extra .pc files for additional functionality
   * like cairo, create convenience .pc files for using some of the optional
     features.  For example, cairomm-ft-1.0, cairomm-pdf-1.0, cairomm-xlib-1.0, etc.
 * Numerous windows build improvements
 * Added a *lot* of automated tests

1.6.2:

   Reed)

   Cairo::logic_error::get_status_code()
 * Added new elements to the surface type enumeration

1.6.0:

 * wrap cairo_format_stride_for_width().  All new cairo 1.6 API should now be

 * Bugfixes:
   - Bug #11972: Cannot build cairomm with Quartz enabled

1.4.4:

 * Added the --enable-api-exceptions=yes/no configure option, to allow
   cairomm to build when exceptions are disabled. For instance, when using
   CXXFLAGS=-fno-exceptions with g++.

1.4.2:

 * Bugfixes:
   - Bug #11596: Fixed broken shared library versioning (Dave Beckett)

   Cairo::RefPtr<>::cast_dynamic() from compiling.

1.2.2:

* Fixed an issue when compiling on windows with MSVC

1.2.0:

* This is the first release that guarantees API and ABI stability
* Changed API:

  - Context::new_sub_path() is now Context::begin_new_sub_path()
* new API:
  - Win32Surface::get_dc()
  - Win32Surface::create() for device-independent bitmaps
* Bugfixes
  - fixed a memory leak where C++ wrapper objects were not being destroyed
* Fixes for compiling with MSVC (also includes project and resource files for
  Visual Studio 2005.  See the MSVC/ directory)

1.1.10:

* API:
  - Wrap new API from cairo 1.2
  - Wrap ScaledFont
* Improved Documentation
* Build fixes

0.6.0:

* API:
  - enumerations are now wrapped within the Cairo namespace.  So, for example,
    CAIRO_FORMAT_ARGB32 becomes Cairo::FORMAT_ARGB32
* Examples: added simple text example translated from Cairo.
* Bugfixes for the Glitz and Windows backends.
* Build and installation improvements (Danilo Piazzalunga)

0.5.0:

* Surface:
  - Created derived classes for PDF, PS, SVG, Glitz,
  X11 and Win32 surfaces, which are only available if your copy
  of cairo supports those surfaces. The X11 and Win32 Surface headers
  must be #included explicitly.
  (Jonathon Jongsma)
  - Added write_to_png() and write_to_png_stream(), available when PNG
  support is available in Cairo.
  (Jonathon Jongsma)
* Examples: Added PNG, PDF, PS, and SVG Surface examples.
  (Jonathon Jongsma)
* Added API documentation generation with doxygen (Jonathon Jongsma)

0.4.0:

* Add Cairo::RefPtr<> and use all reference-counted
  objects via it. Use the static create() methods
  instead of new for these classes.
* Context:
  - Change set_dash(void) to unset_dash().
  - Change rotate_deg() to rotate_degrees().
  - Change identity_matrix() to set_identity_matrix().\
  - Change new_path() to clear_path().
* FontFace: Remove get/set_user_data(), because it seems useless.

0.3.0:

* Context:
  - Change mask_surface() to mask() and
    set_source_surface() to set_source().
  - Add typedef for Matrix, but a real Matrix
  class would be nice.
* Pattern: Created hierarchy of classes.
* Check for errors in constructors.
* Exception: Rename to logic_error, and throw
  std::bad_alloc or std::io_base::failure instead
  when appropriate.
